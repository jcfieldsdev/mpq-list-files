# mpq-list-files

A collection of [list files for the MPQ format used by Blizzard RTS games](https://jcfieldsdev.github.io/mpq-list-files/). The MPQ archive format hashes file names for performance reasons, so a list file is necessary to access files through an archive viewer.

I compiled these list files between 2002 and 2004. They were the most complete I knew about at the time, though there are better sources available now. I'm putting them here for the sake of finding a home for some old files and because I think the documentation pages I made look nice.
